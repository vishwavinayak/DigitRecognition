# Digit Recognition Project
This repository contains a neural network implementation in Python using NumPy for classifying handwritten digits. The project includes data loading, visualization, neural network implementation, and training.
# Introduction
This project implements a simple neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits. It covers the following steps:
---
1. Loading and preprocessing the data
2. Visualizing a sample from the dataset
3. Implementing activation functions (ReLU and Softmax)
4. Initializing the neural network parameters
5. Training the model
6. Evaluating the model's performance

# Installation
Install the requried packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Data
The data consists of handwritten digit images. The dataset is divided into training and test sets:
'train_X.csv': Training set features
'train_label.csv': Training set labels
'test_X.csv': Test set features
'test_label.csv': Test set labels
# Results
After training the model, the notebook provides an evaluation of the model's performance on the test set, including accuracy and visualizations.
